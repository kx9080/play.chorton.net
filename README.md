# Server: play.chorton.net

play.chorton.net is a server I run. I wanted to put up a file host that I could use to get people playing quickly

## Installing Fabric

First you need to download Fabric
Use this link: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/ and click "Download For Windows"

After downloading, double-click on the installer, under Minecraft Version pick 1.20.1.
The loader version shouldn't matter so just stay on the default.
Then press install, and your done installing Fabric.

## Installing Mods

Open the Minecraft Launcher and go to the installations tab.
After this find the installation labeled "fabric-loader-1.20.1" and press the folder button.
Find the "mods" folder in the newly opened file explorer window.

Download the mods folder from this repository by pressing the green code button and click "Download to Zip".
After downloading right-click and press "Extract All" and the "Extract All" again on the pop-up
Move it's files from it's "mods" folder to the mods folder from the .minecraft folder. 

After all that is done. you've got a jolly good time ahead. just launch the fabric minecraft instance from inside the launcher.
